# SimHPC Changelog

> All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Toast Notification System**: `<Toaster />` component from sonner was never mounted — all 12 `toast()` calls were silently doing nothing. Created `App.tsx` with `<Toaster />` configured for 6s duration, 320px min-width, cyan glow theme.
- **Toast Loading→Success Pattern**: Updated `Dashboard.tsx`, `OperatorConsole.tsx`, and `AlphaControlRoom.tsx` to use `toast.loading()` → `toast.success/error()` with the same toast ID, preventing message flashing during GPU queue operations.
- **Toast CSS Overrides**: Added `[data-sonner-toast]` styles in `index.css` for readability on high-res dashboards (1.1rem font, 320px min-width, dark border/shadow).
- **Missing Entry Files**: Created `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `index.html`, `index.css`, and `vite.config.ts` that were deleted during monorepo restructure.
- **Third-Party Cookie Blocks**: Added custom domain strategy (app + auth subdomains) to make Supabase Auth first-party.

### Added
- **Toast Visibility**: 6-second default, 8-second success, 10-second error duration for physics simulation status messages.
- **Toast Styling**: Cyan glow theme (`#00f2ff`), `iconTheme` for success/error, rounded corners, dark terminal aesthetic.
- **Toast Promise Pattern**: `toast.promise()` for simulation submission — loading/success/error linked to API lifecycle.
- **Supabase Realtime Hook**: `useSimulationUpdates` subscribes to `simulation_history` table — completion triggers 10s celebration toast.
- **Simulation History Table**: Real-time dashboard table with status badges (Queued/Processing/Completed/Failed), clickable rows, and download links.
- **Simulation Detail Modal**: Click any simulation row to view AI-generated insights, physics metrics JSON, and PDF download.
- **Admin Analytics Dashboard**: Route at `/admin/analytics` with Active GPU Pods, Total Simulations, and Lead qualification tracking (Hot/Warm/New).
- **Worker Status Sync**: `update_job_status()` method in `worker.py` syncs job status to `simulation_history` table in Supabase.
- **Supabase Migration**: `heartbeat_history.sql` creates `worker_heartbeat`, `simulation_history`, and `leads` tables with Realtime enabled.
- **CORS Hardening**: Changed `api.py` CORS from `["*"]` to explicit allow-list including custom domain.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Mission Control Cockpit v1.6.0**: Complete modular redesign of the operational interface for aerospace/thermal engineers.
- **Component Modularization**: Split the dashboard into independent, high-performance components:
  - `TelemetryPanel.tsx`: 3-channel real-time sparklines (GPU/Convergence/Error).
  - `ActiveSimulations.tsx`: "Decision Panel" with live solver health status (optimal/stiff/diverging).
  - `SimulationLineage.tsx`: ITERATION-tree view for design ancestry and "Flux Delta" tracking.
  - `OperatorConsole.tsx`: High-stakes intervention tools ([INTERCEPT], [CLONE], [BOOST], [CERTIFY]).
  - `GuidanceEngine.tsx`: AI-navigator providing corrective strategy recommendations.
- **Unified Cockpit Aesthetic**: Dark-terminal theme with Mission Control Cyan accents and tabular-numeric UTC synchronization.
### Fixed
- **Unused Declarations**: Removed unused `ShieldAlert` icon import in `ActiveSimulations.tsx` and cleaned up unused `variant` prop in the inline `ThemeToggle` component within `ExperimentNotebook.tsx`.
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Consolidated frontend and root architecture documentation into a single source of truth at `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Naming Consistency**: Standardized all references to `robustness-orchestrator` across the codebase and documentation to eliminate underscore/hyphen oscillation.
- **Project Structure & Hygiene**: Reorganized the monorepo for production readiness:
  - Moved low-level setup logs into `docs/internal/`.
  - Relocated root mockups to `docs/assets/mockups/`.
  - Purged redundant zip archives (`SimHPC_Alpha_*`) and legacy `zip_source.ps1`.
  - Deleted deprecated `archive/` directory to improve build focus.

## Appendix: Mercury AI Usage in Alpha

### 1. Where Mercury Is Used in Alpha

In your current Alpha architecture, **Mercury should only be used in two places**:

#### 1️⃣ Simulation Setup Assistance

Mercury helps interpret user inputs into simulation parameters.

Example:

User input:
```
simulate high temperature stress
```

Mercury converts it into structured parameters:
```
temperature: 45
duration: 48h
wind: moderate
```

Then the simulation module runs.

So the flow is:
```
User Input
↓
Mercury interpretation
↓
Simulation parameters
↓
RunPod simulation
```

#### 2️⃣ Notebook Generation

Mercury writes the **explanatory text** inside the notebook.

Example:

Simulation output:
```
voltage_drop = 8%
temperature = 42C
```

Mercury generates:
```
The simulation indicates that elevated temperatures resulted in an 8% voltage drop,
suggesting increased thermal stress on the battery system.
```

So the flow is:
```
Simulation results
↓
Mercury explanation
↓
Notebook summary
```

### 2. Where Mercury Should NOT Be Used in Alpha

Avoid using Mercury for:

❌ actual physics simulations
❌ experiment selection
❌ simulation validation

### 3. Simple Mercury Health Test

The easiest test is to create a **test endpoint**.

Example:

Node.js example:
```javascript
export async function testMercury(req, res) {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.inceptionlabs.ai/v1/chat/completions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.MERCURY_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "mercury",
      messages: [
        { role: "user", content: "Return the word SIMHPC_OK" }
      ]
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  res.json(data);
}
```

Expected response:
```
SIMHPC_OK
```

If you get that, Mercury is working.

### 4. Test From Terminal

You can test Mercury directly with curl:
```
curl https://api.inceptionlabs.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mercury",
    "messages": [
      {"role":"user","content":"reply SIMHPC_OK"}
    ]
  }'
```

Expected output:
```
SIMHPC_OK
```

### 5. What Alpha Mercury Usage Should Look Like

Ideal Alpha flow:
```
User runs simulation
↓
RunPod executes model
↓
Results returned
↓
Mercury writes explanation
↓
Notebook generated
```

So Mercury is **assistive**, not core.

### 6. Quick Mercury Test Inside Your System

The fastest test you can run right now:

Add this temporary call inside notebook generation:

Prompt:
```
Explain the following simulation result in one sentence.
```

If the notebook text appears → **Mercury is working**.
