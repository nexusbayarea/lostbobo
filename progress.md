## 🧠 SimHPC Stable Backbone (v3.1.0) — Implemented

We have established the final "stable backbone" layer, wiring together typed models, container isolation, and CI-driven deployments.

### 📦 1. End-to-End Type Safety

* Shared Type Layer: Created `packages/types/` containing authoritative `Job` and `JobStatus` models.
* Single Contract: Both API and Worker now import from a shared typing module, eliminating schema drift and ensuring end-to-end type safety from Supabase to GPU.
* Refactored Models: Unified legacy `app/models/job.py` with the new production-grade backbone.

### ⚙️ 2. Production Docker Split

* API Container: `docker/api.Dockerfile` - Stateless, optimized for uvicorn/FastAPI orchestration.
* Worker Container: `docker/worker.Dockerfile` - GPU-ready runtime with `supervisord` process management.
* Supervisor Integration: Production-safe process control for workers, ensuring automatic restarts and proper log aggregation to `/dev/stdout`.

### 🚀 3. CI/CD & Deployment Alignment

* Worker CI: `.github/workflows/worker-ci.yml` - Automated build/tag/push pipeline for immutable worker images.
* RunPod Template: `runpod_deploy.json` - Standardized production deployment spec for GPU autoscaling pods.
* Versioned Deploys: Every worker build is now tagged with a unique Git SHA, providing a clear audit trail of deployed compute logic.

## 🛠️ SimHPC Execution Kernel vNext (April 2026) — Implemented

We have successfully evolved the SimHPC platform into an **adaptive distributed scheduler**, transforming the core into a high-performance execution engine.

### 🧠 Core Upgrades

1. **Predictive Warm Pool Scaling (ML-lite)**
   * Logic: Tracks job arrival velocity over a rolling 10-minute window in Redis.
   * Impact: Pre-scales GPU workers *before* demand spikes, eliminating cold-start bursts by anticipation.
   * Implementation: Integrated into `autoscaler.py` using Redis-backed velocity tracking.

2. **Per-User Priority QoS (SLA-aware)**
   * Logic: Tier-based priority queues (`high`, `med`, `default`).
   * Impact: Pro/Enterprise users get sub-second scheduling; prevents queue starvation by noisy "free" users.
   * Implementation: Multi-queue polling in `worker.py` and tier-aware enqueuing in `job_queue.py`.

3. **Job Coalescing (Duplicate Suppression)**
   * Logic: Fingerprinting `input_params` to detect identical compute requests.
   * Impact: Reduces GPU costs by suppressing redundant simulations; returns existing job IDs for matching requests.
   * Implementation: Fingerprint validation in `enqueue_job` with status-aware coalescing.

4. **Sub-Second Execution Mode (Push Dispatch)**
   * Logic: Hybrid Push/Pull model. API pushes directly to idle workers via FastAPI endpoints.
   * Impact: Removes Redis polling latency entirely for high-priority jobs.
   * Implementation: FastAPI server integrated into `worker.py`; `try_push_to_worker` logic in API layer.

5. **Temporal-lite Workflow Engine (Stateful Orchestration)**
   * Logic: Multi-step simulation management with persistent state in Supabase.
   * Impact: Enables long-running, multi-stage simulations that survive crashes and support complex dependencies.
   * Implementation: `WorkflowService` managing `workflows` and `workflow_steps` tables.

## v3.0.0: Minimal Production Architecture Implementation (April 2026)

### 🧱 Key Changes

* **Added Minimal Production Architecture:**
* Created clean API/Worker split following RunPod GPU execution stability guidelines
* Implemented strict service boundaries:
  * API Service (FastAPI) - accepts jobs, validates, writes to Supabase
  * Worker Service (RunPod GPU) - claims jobs via lease, executes compute, updates state
  * Autoscaler Service - maintains warm pool, scales based on queue depth
* Added Supabase as system-of-truth with proper schema and RPC functions
* Created minimal Dockerfiles for API and worker services
* Added GitHub Actions CI workflows for API and worker services

### 📁 Created Files

* API service: `app/api/main.py`, `app/api/routes.py`
* Core services: `app/core/config.py`, `app/core/db.py`, `app/core/deps.py`, `app/core/queue.py`
* Worker runtime: `worker/runtime/bootstrap.py`, `worker/runtime/execute.py`, `worker/runtime/runner.py`, `worker/runtime/state.py`
* Autoscaler: `autoscaler/main.py`, `autoscaler/policy.py`, `autoscaler/predictor.py`
* Docker: `docker/images/api.Dockerfile`, `docker/images/worker.Dockerfile`, `docker/supervisor/simhpc.conf`
* Supabase: `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/rpc.sql`
* CI: `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/worker-ci.yml`

### ✅ Key Features

* Separation of concerns: API ≠ compute, Worker ≠ orchestration
* Failure tolerance: lease-based job safety, worker restart safe
* Latency optimization: warm pool always active, preloaded runtime
* Deployment simplicity: 2 containers only (API, Worker), autoscaler as optional side service

### 📝 Git History (v3.0.0)

## 🏎️ v4.0.0: Stateless Reasoning & Context Hardening (April 2026)

We have pivoted to a **Stateless Reasoning** architecture to ensure platform stability and prevent context crashes during complex orchestration tasks.

### 🧩 1. Local Build Authority (LBA)

* Pivot: Replaced complex polling/event-driven CI DAGs with a "Single Build Authority" (SBA).
* Authority: `scripts/build.sh` is now the only system allowed to build and push Docker images.
* CI Role: `.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml` now functions only as a "Validation Gate" (linting + structure check).
* Impact: Eliminated "Base Image Drift" and "Layer Stacking" failures in cloud CI.

### 🧠 2. Context Hardening & Stateless Memory

* Token Cap: Enforced a strict **100k token limit** for all AI input/output.
* Memory Pattern: Implemented sliding-window memory with aggressive summarization to keep context lean and predictable.
* Stateless Compute: Transitioned LLM usage from "Memory + Compute" to "Stateless Reasoning per Step," with state persisted externally in `progress.md` and DB.
* Log Suppression: Aggregating logs into structured summaries instead of dumping raw traces.

### 📁 Refactored Infrastructure

* Cleanups: Restored legacy workflows temporarily to salvage validation logic, then properly consolidated them into a single high-efficiency pipeline.
* Core Script: `scripts/build.sh` (Local Build Authority).
* Validation: `.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml` (v3.2.0 - Unified Lint/Test/API Check).

### ✅ Verification (v4.0.0)

* Workflow directory contains ONLY `.gitattributes` and `ci-validation.yml`.
* `AI_DIRECTIVES.md` updated with SRCH (Stateless Reasoning & Context Hardening) protocols.
* Verified `ruff` isolation and `pytest` execution via `uvx` in the consolidated validation workflow.
* Standardized registry: Uses GHCR with lowercase naming convention (Local Push).
* Deterministic tagging: Every build tagged with commit SHA.

## 🏎️ v4.1.0: Git Hygiene & Platform Stability (April 2026)

We have finalized the repository's structural stability and ensured consistent cross-platform behavior through rigorous Git hygiene.

### 🧹 1. Git Index Hygiene

* **Reconciliation**: Successfully reconciled the Git index with the physical disk state. Cleared "ghost" workflow deletions and staged the new consolidated [ci-validation.yml](file:///c:/Users/arche/SimHPC/.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml).
* **Artifact Integrity**: Staged newly created frontend configuration files (`frontend/components.json`, etc.) to stabilize the build context.

### ❄️ 2. Line Ending Standardization (LF)

* **Enforcement**: Created [.gitattributes](file:///c:/Users/arche/SimHPC/.gitattributes) to enforce `LF` (Unix-style) line endings for all critical YML, Python, and Shell scripts.
* **Drift Prevention**: Configured `core.autocrlf false` to prevent cross-platform newline drift that frequently breaks Docker builds and CI checksums.

### 📝 3. Documentation Audit & Compliance

* **Markdown Audit**: Resolved 100+ markdown linting errors (MD004, MD022, MD032, etc.) across [progress.md](file:///c:/Users/arche/SimHPC/progress.md) and [AI_DIRECTIVES.md](file:///c:/Users/arche/SimHPC/AI_DIRECTIVES.md).
* **Standardization**: Unified list styles, fixed heading spacing, and removed trailing punctuation to ensure professional rendering and machine-readability.

### ✅ Verification (v4.1.0)

* **Git Status**: Clean; working tree synchronized with origin.
* **Line Endings**: Verified `LF` enforcement across the `.github/` and `scripts/` directories.
* **Documentation**: Zero linting warnings in the IDE for core project documents.

## 🏎️ v4.2.0: CI Environment Hardening (April 2026) — CURRENT

We have resolved a critical CI false-failure pattern by correctly transitioning from isolated tool execution to project-context execution for the test suite.

### 📦 3. Pydantic v2 Migration

* Added `pydantic-settings` dependency.
* Updated imports to `from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict`.
* Refactored `Settings` class to use `model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")`.
* Ensured CI installs dev extras and runs tests via `uv run`.

### 📦 4. Config Validation Gate (hard pre‑flight)
- Added `app/core/config_gate.py` with required env vars check.
- Added `app/core/bootstrap.py` to run validation then env normalization.
- Updated `app/core/config.py` to be pure Pydantic without side‑effects.
- Added `app/core/startup.py` with `init_app()` to run bootstrap before any imports.
- Documented changes in progress.md.

### 🧪 1. Project Context vs. Isolation

* **Issue**: Identified that `uvx pytest` was running in an isolated sandbox, ignoring the project's [dev] dependencies and failing to load the `pytest-asyncio` plugin.
* **Fix**: Standardized on a shared project environment using `uv venv` and `uv pip install -e .[dev]`.
* **Result**: All tests now execute within the full project context, ensuring `anyio` and `asyncio` plugins are properly registered and configured.

### 🛡️ 2. Architectural Determinism

* **Validation**: Reinforced the `ci-validation.yml` DAG to ensure that linting, dependency installation, and testing follow a strict, deterministic sequence.
* **Self-Healing**: Retained the automated `sed` fix for worker import patterns to preemptively resolve common E402 violations.

### ✅ Verification (v4.2.0)

* **Workflow Logic**: `uv run pytest` confirmed to be the only command allowed for test execution.
* **Plugin Check**: Explicitly confirmed that `asyncio` is active during CI runs to support asynchronous API and Worker tests.
* **Status**: Continuous Integration state is now synchronized with the actual project health.

## 🏎️ v4.3.0: Environment Normalization & Infra Decoupling (April 2026) — CURRENT

We have implemented a definitive **Environment Normalization Layer (ENL)** to decouple application logic from infrastructure-specific naming conventions, resolving persistent "Missing Secret" crashes in CI/CD.

### 🌐 1. The Normalization Layer (`app/core/env.py`)

* **Shift**: Pivoted from domain-specific names (`SUPABASE_URL`) to a generic infrastructure-agnostic schema (`APP_URL`, `API_TOKEN`).
* **Contract**: Defined a canonical mapping between high-level infra secrets (`SB_*`) and internal application variables.
* **Strictness**: Enforced a "Single Point of Mapping" policy. Manual `os.getenv` calls for infra secrets are now strictly prohibited throughout the codebase.

### ⚙️ 2. Validated Configuration Schema

* **Validation**: Refactored `app/core/config.py` to use Pydantic `BaseSettings` against the normalized schema.
* **Portability**: The application is now provider-agnostic. Switching from Supabase to a custom backend only requires updating the environment mapping, not the application logic.

### 🛡️ 3. CI/CD Determinism (SB_* Injection)

* **Refactor**: Updated [.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml](file:///c:/Users/arche/SimHPC/.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml) to provide secrets using the `SB_*` infra convention.
* **Stability**: Eliminated import-time crashes during structural checks by ensuring all required normalized variables are injected into the CI environment.

### ✅ Verification (v4.3.0)

* **Grep Audit**: Manual `SUPABASE_` and direct `SB_` usages in `app/main.py` and `app/utils.py` identified and remediated.
* **CI Pass**: `API Structural Check` verified to succeed with injected infra variables.
* **Code Integrity**: All secondary services (Worker, Config Loader) verified to use the central `settings` authority.
