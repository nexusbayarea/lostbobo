  - Removed redundant `.decode()` calls in `get_job()` (handled by `decode_responses=True`).
  - Decoupled AI report plan check from run submission to allow flexible generation.
  - Removed hardcoded fallback API key; service now requires `SIMHPC_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - Implemented real JWT verification using `python-jose` with `JWT_SECRET_KEY` support.
  - Optimized PDF endpoint to use `BytesIO` and `Response` for direct streaming without disk I/O.

  - Added seeded RNG to `SimulationRunner` for fully reproducible physics approximations.
  - Implemented `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` for `baseline_cache` with FIFO eviction to prevent memory leaks.
  - Improved `_percentage_sampling` to use true uniform distribution instead of alternating sweeps.
  - Added graceful fallback for `SobolAnalyzer` when enterprise modules are missing.
  - Fixed `run_robustness_analysis` signature mismatch in demo code.
- **AI Report Service (ai_report_service.py):**
  - Made template generation data-driven by parsing JSON context from prompts.
  - Tightened temperature integrity regex (`\b\d{2,4}(?:\.\d+)?\s*K\b`) to prevent false positives.
  - Converted `get_ai_report_service` to a proper singleton for multi-worker efficiency.
  - Added HTML escaping and newline normalization (\n/\r\n) to `to_html()` for XSS prevention and consistent rendering.- **Infrastructure (pdf_service.py & Dockerfile):**
  - Resolved font loading failures by using paths relative to `__file__`.
  - Hardened Docker image with `appuser` non-root account and proper permission ownership.
  - Streamlined container startup by running `uvicorn` directly, removing redundant CORS middleware layers.

## Architectural Improvements

### AI Report Service (`ai_report_service.py`) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Multi-User Safe Cache System ✅
- **Current:** File-based cache (`./ai_report_cache`) without user/simulation scoping
- **Issues:** No expiration, no concurrency protection, race conditions on parallel writes
- **Fix:** Migrate to Redis-backed cache with per-user and per-simulation scoping, TTL enforcement, and atomic operations

#### 2. Stable Report ID Hashing ✅
- **Current:** `json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)` vulnerable to float precision drift and dict ordering
- **Fix:** Normalize floats (round), strip metadata fields, define canonical schema before hashing

#### 3. Enhanced Vocabulary Enforcement ✅
- **Current:** Only enforces prohibited phrases
- **Fix:** 
  - Enforce allowed indicator usage
  - Block speculative language
  - Block modal certainty drift
  - Add Pydantic validation for structured JSON output from LLM

#### 4. Singleton Pattern Safety ✅
- **Current:** Global singleton not safe for multi-worker Uvicorn/Gunicorn
- **Fix:** Remove reliance on singleton for shared cache; use Redis for all shared state

#### 5. Deterministic Metadata Lock ✅
- **Current:** Only stores `input_hash` and `version`
- **Fix:** Add structured metadata:
  - `simulation_id`, `solver_version`, `mesh_checksum`, `parameter_hash`
  - `ai_prompt_version` for cache versioning

---

### Robustness Service (`robustness_service.py`) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Deterministic Isolation ✅
- **Principle:** Robustness layer must NEVER call AI, modify solver outputs, or reformat results
- **Contract:** `run_simulation(params) → raw_result`, `aggregate_results(results) → statistics`

#### 2. Random Seed Control (Enterprise Critical) ✅
- **Current:** No seed parameter or logging
- **Fix:** 
  - Accept user-defined seed parameter
  - Log seed in metadata: `random.seed(user_defined_seed)`, `np.random.seed(user_defined_seed)`
  - Return seed in metadata for reproducibility

#### 3. Concurrency & GPU Safety ✅
- **Current:** ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound work
- **Fix:** Use `ProcessPoolExecutor` or external worker system; implement GPU over-subscription guards

#### 4. Sensitivity Ranking Correctness ✅
- **Fix:** 
  - Normalize influence coefficients
  - Guard against zero variance with epsilon
  - Handle signed values and ranking stability for close values

#### 5. Non-Convergence Handling ✅
- **Fix:**
  - Track failed runs separately
  - Exclude from variance calculations
  - Log all non-convergent cases with reason

#### 6. Statistical Integrity ✅
- **Current:** Confidence intervals assume normal distribution
- **Fix:** Document distribution assumption in metadata

#### 7. Structured Output ✅
- **Fix:** Return structured object:
  ```python
  {
    "raw_results": [...],
    "statistics": {...},
    "metadata": {
      "seed", "sampling_method", "run_count", "solver_version"
    }
  }
  ```

---

### API Layer (`api.py`) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1. Authentication Enforcement ✅
- **Critical:** All protected endpoints must validate JWT and extract user ID
- **Never trust frontend for plan checks or rate limits**

#### 2. Token/Plan Enforcement (Backend) ✅
- **Enforce inside API layer:**
  ```python
  if user.plan == "free" and run_count > 5:
      raise HTTPException(403)
  ```

#### 3. AI Report Endpoint Metering ✅
- **Critical:** Check subscription, deduct tokens, prevent double deduction
- **Implement idempotency key to prevent retry charges**

#### 4. Background Tasks for Long-Running Simulations ✅
- **Current:** Blocking request handler
- **Fix:** Submit job → Return job_id → Poll status → Store results

#### 5. Input Validation ✅
- **Fix:** Use Pydantic models for all request types to prevent missing fields, type mismatches, and malicious payloads

#### 6. Rate Limiting ✅
- **Apply to:** Report generation, simulation runs, status polling
- **Use Redis-backed rate limiters

---

### Enterprise Readiness Gaps ✅ COMPLETED

Required for enterprise clients:
- [x] Solver version logged in all responses
- [x] Random seed logged and returned in metadata
- [x] Reproducibility guarantee with seed
- [x] Raw run data export capability
- [x] AI report versioning
- [x] Robustness algorithm versioning

*Last Updated: March 10, 2026*

### March 10, 2026 (Footer Logo, Global Background & Theme Toggle)
- **Protected Routes**: Implemented `ProtectedRoute` component and wrapped dashboard routes (`/dashboard`, `/dashboard/alpha`, `/dashboard/notebook`) to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Experiment Notebook Alignment**: Fixed responsive grid layout and row alignment issues in both light and dark modes to prevent card overlap and squishing.
- **Theme-Aware Styling**: Refactored `ExperimentNotebook.tsx` to use `bg-background` and `text-foreground` classes, ensuring proper color adaptation during mode switches.
- **Footer Logo Color Fix**: Changed SimHPC logo "Sim" text to `text-inherit` to properly adapt to the footer's dark background across all themes.
- **Global Background Consistency**: Updated all page backgrounds (SignIn, SignUp, Dashboard, etc.) to use `bg-background` (HSL 46° 38% 91%) matching the homepage color #F1EDE0.
- **ExperimentNotebook Theme Toggle**: Added ThemeToggle component to the Experiment Notebook page header, matching the rest of the website's bright/dark mode functionality.
- **Notebook Color Updates**: Updated all hardcoded colors in ExperimentNotebook.tsx to use theme-aware classes (dark: prefix) for proper light/dark mode support.

### March 10, 2026 (Magic Link Demo Token System)
- **Magic Link Demo Access:**
  - Implemented a complete alpha pilot onboarding system using secure, usage-limited magic link tokens.
  - **Backend (`demo_access.py`):**
    - `POST /api/v1/demo/magic-link` — Validates demo token and returns session info with remaining runs.
    - `GET /api/v1/demo/usage` — Returns current usage stats (remaining, limit, used, expired).
    - `POST /api/v1/demo/use-run` — Atomically decrements usage count per simulation run.
    - `POST /api/v1/demo/create` — Admin-only endpoint to generate new magic links (requires `SIMHPC_API_KEY`).
  - **Supabase `demo_access` Table:**
    - Schema: `id`, `email`, `token_hash` (SHA-256), `usage_limit`, `usage_count`, `expires_at`, `created_at`, `ip_address`.
    - RLS policy restricts access to `service_role` only.
    - Indexes on `token_hash` and `email` for fast lookups.
  - **Dual-Layer Storage:** Supabase (persistent) + Redis (fast reads) for redundancy.
  - **Security:** Tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes — raw tokens never persisted. IP logging on all validation attempts.
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - **`DemoAccess.tsx`**: New `/demo/:token` route page with animated validation flow (validating → success → redirect to dashboard).
  - **`DemoBanner.tsx`**: Dashboard banner showing remaining demo runs with progress bar, color-coded warnings (blue → amber → red), and upgrade CTAs.
  - **`Dashboard.tsx`**: Integrated demo state tracking — reads from localStorage, refreshes via API on mount, decrements usage on each simulation run.
  - **`api.ts`**: Added `validateDemoToken()`, `getDemoUsage()`, and `decrementDemoUsage()` methods with `DemoValidationResponse` and `DemoUsageResponse` interfaces.
  - **`App.tsx`**: Registered `/demo/:token` route.
- **CLI Tool (`generate_demo_link.py`):**
  - Two modes: API (talks to running backend) and Direct (writes to Redis/Supabase locally).
  - Outputs formatted magic link ready to send to alpha pilots.
  - Usage: `python generate_demo_link.py --email pilot@coreshell.com --runs 5`
- **Demo Flow:**
  ```
  Generate link → Send to pilot → Pilot clicks → Token validated → Session created →
  Dashboard with usage banner → 5 simulations allowed → Demo ends → "Request More Access"
  ```

### March 8, 2026 (Abuse Prevention & Free Tier Security)

#### Abuse Prevention Architecture
Implemented a multi-layered security strategy to prevent free tier exploitation and protect expensive GPU resources:

1.  **Identity Verification (First Barrier):**
    - Enforced **Google OAuth** or **Verified Email Link** (Magic Link) for all signups via Supabase.
    - Disabled unverified disposable email registration.

2.  **Fingerprinting & Hardware Tracking:**
    - Implemented `user_security` tracking storing: `ip_address`, `device_hash` (browser-native fingerprint), `user_agent`, and `signup_time`.
    - **Device Fingerprint:** Generated from browser primitives (User Agent, Language, Screen Resolution) to identify unique hardware even behind VPNs.

3.  **Cross-Account Linking Prevention:**
    - **Limit:** Max 2 free accounts per IP.
    - **Limit:** Max 1 free account per device.
    - Automated blocking of new signups exceeding these thresholds.

4.  **Compute Guardrails (Resource Protection):**
    - **Free Tier Limits:**
        - 1 concurrent simulation max.
        - Mandatory small mesh limit.
        - Hard execution timeout (60 seconds).
        - No batch runs or AI reports.
    - **Cost Estimation:** Pre-simulation check for estimated compute cost; runs exceeding the free limit are blocked before GPU allocation.

5.  **Queue & Rate Management:**
    - **Delayed Execution:** Free tier jobs are assigned to a low-priority queue with a mandatory 30–120 second delay to discourage bot-driven bulk processing.
    - **API Rate Limiting:** 5 API calls per minute for free users via Redis-backed rate limiters.

6.  **Bot Mitigation:**
    - **Invisible Honeypot:** Added hidden form fields in signup/login to trap and block automated bot submissions.

7.  **Friction-Based Escalation:**
    - **Credit Card Trigger:** After 5 free simulations, users must provide a card (Stripe SetupIntent) to continue, even if remaining on the free tier.

8.  **Abuse Monitoring Dashboard:**
    - Implemented real-time tracking of `accounts_per_ip` and `free_to_paid` conversion rates to identify emerging abuse patterns.

#### Free Tier Technical Specification
| Feature | Free Tier Policy |
|---------|------------------|
| Simulations | 1 concurrent |
| Mesh Size | Small only |
| Runtime | 60s maximum |
| AI Reports | Disabled |
| Queue Priority | Low (Delayed) |
| Account Limit | 1 per device / 2 per IP |
| Rate Limit | 5 calls/minute |

#### Security Posture & Production Deployment Strategy
Implemented a secure, isolated deployment architecture to protect core intellectual property (AI/Physics logic) during beta:

1.  **Frontend Repository:**
    - Hosted at: https://github.com/NexusBayArea/SimHPC
    - **Purpose:** GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring the backend codebase, AI logic, and orchestrator secrets remain protected.
    - **Hardened `.gitignore`:** Aggressively excludes all backend folders (`robustness_orchestrator/`, `ai/`, `sdk/`), Python files, and Docker configurations.

2.  **Backend/AI Privacy:**
    - Established "Backend Closed-Source" policy: Core business logic (MFEM/SUNDIALS integration, Mercury AI RAG, PDF generation) remains in a private monorepo or local git.
    - Deployment to RunPod GPU instances is managed directly from the private environment.

3.  **Supabase Standalone Configuration:**
    - **Workflow:** Managed via the Supabase Dashboard and local CLI (`supabase db push`), bypassing the need to sync the monorepo or create a separate schema repo.
    - Protects the database schema and RLS policies from being linked to the frontend repository.

4.  **Security Checklist:**
    - [x] Create `simhpc-frontend` repo with only frontend code.
    - [x] Add hardened `.gitignore` for frontend isolation.
    - [x] Disconnect/Prevent Supabase from requiring full repo access.
    - [x] Host monorepo privately (local + RunPod volume backups).
    - [x] Configure GitHub Pages deployment from NexusBayArea/SimHPC.

#### Experiment Notebook (New Feature)
Launched a persistent research workspace for automated experiment tracking and knowledge management:

1.  **Automated Logging:** Every simulation run now generates a structured experiment entry with parameters, results, and metadata.
2.  **Comparison Engine:** Side-by-side comparison of multiple experiments (e.g., C-rate sweeps, thermal stability studies) to identify optimal engineering parameters.
3.  **Observation & Conclusion:** Researchers can add qualitative observations and final conclusions to each experiment, building a searchable knowledge base.
4.  **Replay Capability:** One-click "Replay" to reload all parameters and solver configurations from any past experiment into the active dashboard.
5.  **Visual Analytics:** Integrated sparklines and mini-bar charts for rapid assessment of parameter variation effects on convergence and stability.
6.  **Timeline Tracking:** Visual history of experiments grouped by research phase, facilitating long-term study continuity.
7.  **Dashboard Integration:** Dedicated sidebar navigation with "New Feature" badge and responsive collapse states.
