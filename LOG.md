### Actions Taken

1. **Reviewed Provenance Storage Implementation**
   - Verified existing `backend/core/kernel/lineage/storage.py` with ProvenanceStorage class
   - Confirmed import path uses `backend.app.core.supabase` (not `backend.core.services.supabase_client`)

2. **Added Missing `create_snapshot` Method**
   - File: `backend/core/kernel/lineage/storage.py`
   - Added `hashlib` and `json` imports
   - Implemented `create_snapshot()` method for audit/replay functionality

3. **Created Database Migration**
   - File: `deploy/supabase/migrations/20260510_provenance_storage.sql`
   - Added columns to execution_lineage: trace_id, correlation_id, causation_id
   - Created `provenance_nodes` table with unique constraint on (execution_id, node_type, node_name)
   - Created `provenance_edges` table
   - Created `provenance_snapshots` table with integrity_hash
   - Added indexes for graph traversal performance
   - Configured RLS policies for service_role

### Notes

- Log.md already present in .gitignore (line 29)
- ProvenanceStorage uses singleton pattern via `_instance` class variable
- Graph updates happen in real-time during event storage
- Snapshots use SHA256 hash of canonical JSON for integrity verification

### Actions Taken

1. **Updated LineageCollector to Use ProvenanceStorage**
   - File: `backend/core/kernel/lineage/collector.py`

### Notes

- LineageVisualizer already exists at `frontend/src/components/LineageVisualizer.tsx`
- Backend API `/lineage/executions` already implemented in `backend/app/api/lineage.py`

### Actions Taken

1. **Created Helm Chart for SimHPC Core**

   - Added trailing newlines to all helm files

### Notes

- Helm chart supports GPU scheduling: fractional GPU, MPS, node selector, tolerations

### Notes

- VPA requires CRDs: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/download/vertical-pod-autoscaler-1.0.0/crd.yaml
- HPA and VPA work together: HPA handles replica count, VPA handles resource requests
- GPU resources (nvidia.com/gpu) are not managed by VPA
