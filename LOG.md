### Multi-Layer RAG Implementation
- **Implemented Three-Layer Retrieval:** Created a `RAGRouter` in `backend/runtime/rag/` that orchestrates parallel searches across:
    - **Layer 1 (DocumentIndex):** Vector-based search for research papers and document chunks using `match_chunks` RPC.
    - **Layer 2 (StructuredIndex):** Property-based search for material constants and physical parameters.
    - **Layer 3 (ExperimentIndex):** Historical search for previous simulation runs and cached results.
- **Shared RAG Utilities:** Developed `backend/runtime/rag/utils.py` to centralize:
    - `embed_text`: Standardized 1536-dimensional embedding generation.
    - `combine_results`: Cross-layer deduplication logic supporting multiple ID formats (`id`, `chunk_id`, `hash`).
    - `get_tenant_from_context`: Foundation for tenant-isolated retrieval.
- **Verification:** Successfully validated `RAGRouter` initialization and import path integrity.

### Core Utility Hardening
- **Supabase Client (backend/app/core/supabase.py):**
    - Refactored `get_supabase` to be error-tolerant, returning `None` instead of raising exceptions when `SB_URL` or `SB_SECRET_KEY` are missing.
    - Added `get_supabase_client` as a standardized alias to support existing codebase patterns.
    - Implemented lazy global initialization for the `supabase` instance.

### Observational Memory Integration & Kernel Stabilization
- **Stability Fixes:**
    - Resolved a critical `F821 Undefined name 'Kernel'` runtime error in `backend/core/kernel/memory/observational.py`.
    - Handled circular dependency between `Kernel` and `Observer`/`Reflector` using `TYPE_CHECKING` and `from __future__ import annotations`.
    - Automated the resolution of 11 project-wide linting issues (import sorting, type annotations) across the kernel layer.
- **Observational Memory Loop:**
    - Fully integrated `AutoResearchEngine` with the memory layer. Experiment results now automatically trigger events, which the `Observer` transforms into persistent observations.
    - Wired high-confidence observations to trigger automatic `Reflector` runs, updating the global `WorldModel` belief system.
- **API Readiness:**
    - Registered the `/observational` router in the main `api_router.py`, enabling the `/observe` and `/reflect` endpoints.
    - Verified endpoint connectivity through `backend/app/api/routes/observational.py`.
- **Quality Assurance & Testing:**
    - Fixed a bug in `FakeQueue.mark_failure` (missing retry/DLQ logic) which was causing functional tests to fail.
    - Successfully executed an end-to-end integration test of the entire Observational Memory chain.
    - Verified that `backend/tools/run_ci.py` returns a clean status for all gates.
- **Git Hygiene:**
    - Corrected `.gitignore` to treat `progress.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SYSTEM.md`, and `LOG.md` as local-only files.
    - Untracked these files from the Git index while preserving them on the local disk.
    - Recovered `LOG.md` from history after an accidental deletion and ensured it remains untracked.

## May 6, 2026 [03:00 PM]

### WORLD_SIMULATE Command Handler Added

- Applied ruff formatting and linting fixes across the backend.
- Verified that the pre-commit checks pass.

## May 6, 2026 [10:20 AM]

### Documentation & Repository Decoupling Finalization
- **Repository Decoupling:**

    - Corrected `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits of internal project logs.
- **Quality Assurance:**
    - Verified all project documentation resides correctly on the local disk without version control entanglement.
    - Confirmed that the recent kernel stabilization and memory integration changes are correctly reflected in the project log.

## May 6, 2026 [11:15 AM]

### Rust Toolchain & PyIceberg Build Hardening
- **Environment Preparation:**
    - Installed the Rust toolchain (`rustc`, `cargo`) on the local Windows environment.
    - Added high-performance components: `rust-analyzer`, `rustfmt`, and `clippy`.
    - Managed critical disk space constraints (~1GB free) by using the `--profile minimal` installer flag and purging `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest` caches.
- **CI/CD Build Stability:**
    - **ci.sh Update:** Integrated Rust auto-installation logic into `backend/ci.sh` to ensure the toolchain is available in CI environments for `pyiceberg-core` compilation.
    - **Dockerfile Update:** Modified `backend/Dockerfile` builder stage to include `curl`, `build-essential`, and `rustup`. This ensures robust builds for architectures without pre-compiled wheels (e.g., Python 3.14).
- **Dependency Orchestration:**
    - Synchronized `pyproject.toml` with the `iceberg` and `full` dependency extras.
    - Verified architectural alignment with the `uv` package manager.
- **Repository Integrity:**
    - Re-verified the local-only status of `LOG.md` and other internal documents.
    - Performed a final project-wide `ruff` audit and pushed the architectural hardening changes to `main`.

## May 6, 2026 [11:20 AM]

### Environmental Fix: PyIceberg & MSVC Build Failure
- **Issue:** The local environment was using **Python 3.14.3** (experimental), which lacks pre-compiled wheels for several dependencies (including `pyiceberg` and `pydantic-core`). This forced `uv` to attempt a source build, which failed due to missing **Microsoft C++ Build Tools (MSVC)**.
- **Resolution:**
    - Installed **Python 3.12.12** (stable) using `uv python install 3.12`.
    - Switched the project virtual environment to use Python 3.12.
    - Synchronized all dependencies using `uv sync --python 3.12`.
    - **Outcome:** `uv` successfully downloaded pre-built wheels for all packages, bypassing the need for a local compiler entirely.
- **Verification:** Confirmed `pyiceberg 0.11.1` is operational in the new environment.
