## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Experiment Notebook**: A persistent research workspace for automated logging, side-by-side experiment comparison, and "Replay" capability for solver parameters.
- **Abuse Prevention System**: Multi-layered security including device fingerprinting, IP-based account limits, honeypot fields, and compute guardrails (60s timeouts, delayed queues).
- **Mercury AI Integration**: Finalized transition to Inception Labs' Mercury AI for engineering-grade reports with numerical anchoring.
- Secure Repo Strategy: Migrated to a split-repository architecture, isolating the frontend in `lostbobo` (https://github.com/NexusBayArea/lostbobo.git) while keeping backend and AI logic closed-source.


### Security
- Implemented frontend-only repository strategy for Vercel deployment.
- Hardened `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of backend orchestrator logic.
- Disconnected Supabase from GitHub sync to prevent unauthorized schema access.
