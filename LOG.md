### Multi-Layer RAG Implementation
- **Implemented Three-Layer Retrieval:** Created a `RAGRouter` in `backend/runtime/rag/` that orchestrates parallel searches across:
    - **Layer 1 (DocumentIndex):** Vector-based search for research papers and document chunks using `match_chunks` RPC.
    - **Layer 2 (StructuredIndex):** Property-based search for material constants and physical parameters.
    - **Layer 3 (ExperimentIndex):** Historical search for previous simulation runs and cached results.
- **Shared RAG Utilities:** Developed `backend/runtime/rag/utils.py` to centralize:
    - `embed_text`: Standardized 1536-dimensional embedding generation.
    - `combine_results`: Cross-layer deduplication logic supporting multiple ID formats (`id`, `chunk_id`, `hash`).
    - `get_tenant_from_context`: Foundation for tenant-isolated retrieval.
- **Verification:** Successfully validated `RAGRouter` initialization and import path integrity.

### Core Utility Hardening
- **Supabase Client (backend/app/core/supabase.py):**
    - Refactored `get_supabase` to be error-tolerant, returning `None` instead of raising exceptions when `SB_URL` or `SB_SECRET_KEY` are missing.
    - Added `get_supabase_client` as a standardized alias to support existing codebase patterns.
    - Implemented lazy global initialization for the `supabase` instance.

### Git & Deployment

### Domain-Aware Multi-Layer RAG Implementation
- **Router Update:** Updated `backend/runtime/rag/router.py` to incorporate domain classification and routing to specific index layers.
- **Base Index Creation:** Created `backend/runtime/rag/base_index.py` as an abstract base class for all domain-specific indexes.
- **Document Index Update:** Modified `backend/runtime/rag/document_index.py` to inherit from `BaseIndex` and include domain filtering in its search logic.
- **New Index Creation:** Created `backend/runtime/rag/model_index.py` and `backend/runtime/rag/dataset_index.py` for domain-specific model parameters and experimental data retrieval, respectively.
- **Indentation Correction:** Fixed indentation issues in `backend/runtime/rag/model_index.py` and `backend/runtime/rag/dataset_index.py`.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Successfully ran `ruff format .` and `ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes` across the `backend` directory, ensuring all new and modified files adhere to coding standards.
- **CI Verification:** Executed `python tools/run_ci.py` to confirm that all continuous integration checks passed after these implementations.
- **Version Control:** Committed the new domain-aware RAG structure and code quality fixes, then pushed these changes to the remote Git repository.

### Full Plugin Framework Implementation
- **Base Plugin Class Creation:** Created `backend/plugins/base.py` to define the abstract base class for all SimHPC plugins, enforcing a standardized interface.
- **Plugin Registry Update:** Updated `backend/plugins/registry.py` to include enhanced registration logic, methods for listing all registered plugins, and filtering by category.
- **Plugin Package Initialization Update:** Modified `backend/plugins/__init__.py` to correctly expose the `PluginBase` and `PluginRegistry` classes.
- **Example EV Battery Plugin Creation:** Implemented an example domain-specific plugin `backend/plugins/ev_battery/plugin.py`, demonstrating how to register and use plugins within the framework.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Successfully ran `ruff format .` and `ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes` across the `backend` directory, ensuring all newly created and modified plugin files adhere to coding standards.
- **CI Verification:** Executed `python tools/run_ci.py` to confirm that all continuous integration checks passed after the plugin framework implementation.
- **Version Control:** Committed the new full plugin framework and associated code quality fixes, then pushed these changes to the remote Git repository.

### Plugin Auto-Discovery System Implementation
- **Loader Creation:** Created `backend/plugins/loader.py` to automatically discover and load plugins by scanning the `backend/plugins/` directory.
- **Registry Update:** Updated `backend/plugins/registry.py` to provide a more informative error message when a plugin is not found, including a list of available plugins.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Successfully ran `ruff format .` and `ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes` across the `backend` directory, ensuring the new `loader.py` and updated `registry.py` adhere to coding standards.
- **CI Verification:** Executed `python tools/run_ci.py` to confirm that all continuous integration checks passed after the implementation of the auto-discovery system.
- **Version Control:** Committed the new plugin auto-discovery system files and code quality fixes, then pushed these changes to the remote Git repository.

### Autonomous Simulation Agent Implementation
- **Core File Creation:** Created `backend/runtime/agent/autonomous.py` with the core logic for the closed-loop experimentation engine.

### Services Implementation (Claim Extractor, Orchestrator, Trust Engine)
- **Claim Extractor:** Created `backend/services/extractor/claim_extractor.py` with a stub implementation for parsing LLM output into structured claims.
- **Orchestrator + Cascade:** Created `backend/services/orchestrator/cascade.py`, implementing a cascaded verification flow (extract → validate → simulate).
- **Trust Score + Certificate Engine:** Created `backend/services/trust/trust_engine.py` for computing trust scores and issuing certificates.
- **Import Fix for Typing:** Corrected `backend/services/trust/trust_engine.py` by adding `from typing import Dict, List, Any` to resolve undefined name errors for type hints.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Successfully ran `ruff format .` and `ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes` across the `backend` directory, ensuring new service files adhere to coding standards.
- **CI Verification:** Executed `python tools/run_ci.py`. The linting step (`tools.ci_steps.lint`) identified an unresolved "Undefined name `get_supabase_client`" error in `trust_engine.py`, causing the CI to fail. All other CI checks passed.
